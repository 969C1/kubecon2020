# KubeCon 2020
##  Putting Apache Cassandra on Automatic with Kubernetesâ„¢

![OK](https://github.com/DataStax-Academy/kubecon-cassandra-workshop/blob/master/3-materials/images/00-screenplay.png?raw=true)

In this repository, you'll find everything for the Cassandra Kubernetes Workshop:
- Materials used during presentations
- Hands-on exercises

Feel free to bookmark this page for future reference!

## Materials and Communications

* [TBD Workshop recording](https://youtu.be/nRf2M4OjGpU)
* [TBD  Presentation](3-materials/presentation.pdf)
* [Discord chat](https://bit.ly/cassandra-workshop)
* [Q&A: community.datastax.com](https://community.datastax.com)

## Exercises

To follow along with the hands-on exercises during the workshop, you need to have a docker-ready machine with at least a 4-core + 8 GB RAM. **KubeCon attendees can request a training cloud instance** using [this link](https://kubecon2020.datastaxtraining.com/). Notice that training cloud instances will be available only during the workshop and to be terminated 24 hours later.

* If you are using **your own computer** or your own cloud node, please check the requirements and install the missing tools as explained [TODO NEED TO ADD here](./0-setup-your-cluster-own).
* If you are using **a cloud training instance** provided by DataStax, relax as we have you covered: prerequisites are installed already. Please do the very last steps as explained [there](./0-setup-your-cluster-datastax)

# Setting up and Monitoring Cassandra

### Setup the Repo
helm repo add datastax https://datastax.github.io/charts
helm repo update

### Helm 3 Install
helm install cass-operator datastax/TODO

TODO mess with the values.yaml

helm install super-cassandra ./TODO

Navagate to http://localhost:9090 to start seeing metrics

# Working with data

### Deploy Pet Clinic App
https://github.com/DataStax-Academy/kubecon2020#Scaling-up-and-down
# Scaling up and down
### Get current running config
For many basic config options you can change values in the values.yaml file.  Next we will scale our cluster using this method.

First lets check what our current running values are using the `helm get manifest k8ssandra` command.  This command is used to expose all the current running values in the system. 

### Scale the cluster up
`helm get manifest k8ssandra | grep size` Notice the value of `size: 2` in the TODO.yaml 

Open the values.yaml and find the nodeCount paramater

Change the value from 2 to 3

`nodeCount: 3`

Next we need to apply the change.  To do this type `helm upgrade` in the command line

Run `helm get manifest k8ssandra | grep size` again

notice the `size: 3`

### Scale the cluster down
If there is a need to make a config change without needing to edit a file the --set flag can be used from the CLI. Run the following command

`helm upgrade --set nodeCount=2`

Next verify the command made the change by checking the size param from the running config 

`helm get manifest k8ssandra | grep size`
