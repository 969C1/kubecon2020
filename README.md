![OK](https://github.com/DataStax-Academy/kubecon-cassandra-workshop/blob/master/3-materials/images/00-screenplay.png?raw=true)

In this repository, you'll find everything for the Cassandra Kubernetes Workshop:
- Materials used during presentations
- Hands-on exercises

Feel free to bookmark this page for future reference!

## Materials and Communications

* [Workshop recording](https://youtu.be/nRf2M4OjGpU)
* [Presentation](3-materials/presentation.pdf)
* [Discord chat](https://bit.ly/cassandra-workshop)
* [Q&A: community.datastax.com](https://community.datastax.com)

## Exercises

To follow along with the hands-on exercises during the workshop, you need to have a docker-ready machine with at least a 4-core + 8 GB RAM. **KubeCon attendees can request a training cloud instance** using [this link](https://kubecon2020.datastaxtraining.com/). Notice that training cloud instances will be available only during the workshop and to be terminated 24 hours later.

* If you are using **your own computer** or your own cloud node, please check the requirements and install the missing tools as explained [here](./0-setup-your-cluster-own).
* If you are using **a cloud training instance** provided by DataStax, relax as we have you covered: prerequisites are installed already. Please do the very last steps as explained [there](./0-setup-your-cluster-datastax)
